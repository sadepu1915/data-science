* This is an example from Snedecor and Cochran of a
Nested Design involving an experiment
to investigate the variability of calcium concentration
in the leaves of turnip greens.
Four plants were randomly selected
and then three leaves were randomly
selected from each plant. Two 100-mg samples
from each leaf. The amount of calcium is determined
by microchemical methods;
